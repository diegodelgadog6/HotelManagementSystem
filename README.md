# HotelManagementSystem
This C++ console-based hotel management system simulates essential hotel operations such as guest check-in, check-out, and dynamic room assignment. It manages a fixed inventory of 40 rooms, each with individual tracking of guest name, number of adults and children, available credit, and current charges. The system calculates base rates based on guest composition (adults and children), applies extra charges only if they stay within the available credit, and prevents overbooking by checking room availability before assignments.

Designed with object-oriented programming principles in mind, the system is modular and scalable. It uses two core classes: Habitacion (Room), which encapsulates room-specific logic, and Hotel, which orchestrates room management. The application supports real-time interaction via console input and output, making it suitable for academic projects or entry-level software simulations in hospitality management. It also includes occupancy reporting and total revenue calculation based on current guests.
